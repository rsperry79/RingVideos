# Ring Videos Downloader

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mmckechney/RingVideos/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mmckechney/RingVideos/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This simple console app (written in .NET Core) will allow you do perform a bulk download of your [Ring.com](https://www.ring.com) videos.
You can filter the videos you download by date range, whether they are starred, the event kind (motion / doorbell ring / live-view / alarm), and by what Ring's computer vision detected in the recording (person, vehicle, animal, etc.).

## Usage

  -P, --person                           Only download videos where a person was detected (shortcut for `--detection-type human`)
  -k, --kind <kind>                      Only download events of this kind: `motion`, `ding`, `on_demand`, `alarm`
  -D, --detection-type <type>            Only download events where Ring CV classified the detection as this type.
                                         Common values: `human`, `vehicle`, `animal`, `package`, `other_motion`

```

### Filter reference

The following filters can be combined (they are AND-ed together):

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-s` / `--start`, `-e` / `--end` | Restrict to events in a date range. |
| `-m` / `--maxcount` | Cap the total number of videos downloaded. |
| `--id` / `--device-id` | Restrict to a specific camera/doorbell. |
| `starred` (command) | Only events you starred/favorited in the Ring app. |
| `-P` / `--person` | Only events where Ring CV detected a person. |
| `-k` / `--kind` | Only events of a specific kind (`motion`, `ding`, `on_demand`, `alarm`). |
| `-D` / `--detection-type` | Only events whose Ring CV classification matches (e.g. `human`, `vehicle`, `animal`, `package`). |

Notes on detection filters:

- Ring populates `cv_properties` only for events evaluated by its computer vision. Older events, `on_demand` (live view) events, and events from devices without CV may not include this data and will be excluded when `--person` or `--detection-type` is used.
- `--person` is equivalent to `--detection-type human` (but also matches legacy events that only set `person_detected=true` without a detection type).
- Events without a ready recording (e.g. live-view-only events or recordings still processing) are always skipped — previously these would fail at download time.

### Examples

Download every video from the last 24 hours where a person was detected:

```
RingVideos all --person -s "yesterday" --path D:\RingVideos
```

Download only doorbell-button presses (not motion events) from a specific device:

```
RingVideos all -k ding --id 123456789 --path D:\RingVideos
```

Download starred clips where Ring classified the detection as a vehicle:

```
RingVideos starred --detection-type vehicle --path D:\RingVideos
```

## Version history

- Version 3.2: Added event-kind and detection-type filters (`--kind`, `--detection-type`, `--person`). Events without a ready recording are now skipped automatically.
- Version 3.0: Added additional download threading and retry options and (hopefully) better download status reporting in the console.
- Version 2.0: Updated calling syntax to use sub-commands vs flags. Can now also create and download a current snapshot
- Version 1.3: Updated to leverage the Ring.Api Nuget package to interact with the Ring API
- Version 1.2: The app will also save your settings to a local config file. This will allow you to just re-run the app with no parameters and have it download the videos since your last run.
